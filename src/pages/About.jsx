          Hello! My name is Jacob Foote. I am a full-stack web developer who
          loves learning new things. I completed the Web Development Program at
          Devmountain in December of 2023. When I am not coding, you can find me
          working on cars, snowboarding, biking, or usually spending time with
          my wife and son.
